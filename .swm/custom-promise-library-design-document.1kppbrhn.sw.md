title: Custom Promise Library Design Document
---
#### Overview

- **Project Name**: Custom Promise Library

- **Purpose**: The purpose of this project is to deepen understanding of asynchronous programming in TypeScript by implementing a custom Promise library. The project aims to explore the internal workings of Promises, including asynchronous execution, chaining, error handling, and extending with custom features.

#### Goals

- **Feature Exploration**: To experiment with additional features not necessarily present in the native Promise API, enhancing learning through implementation challenges.

- **Performance Insights**: Explore and document performance characteristics and optimizations in comparison to native Promises.

#### Core Functionality

- **Executor Function**: Ability to execute a function that resolves or rejects a promise.

- **State Management**: Manage promise states (pending, fulfilled, rejected) and ensure correct transitions based on asynchronous operations.

- **Then and Catch Methods**: Implement `.then()` for chaining and `.catch()` for error handling, adhering to Promises/A+ specifications where applicable.

- **Advanced Methods**: Explore the implementation of methods such as `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, `Promise.resolve`, and `Promise.reject`.

#### Architecture

- **Modular Design**: The library will be designed with modularity in mind, separating core logic, utilities, and extended features into distinct modules for clarity and maintainability.

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling within the library to manage exceptions gracefully and provide clear debugging messages to users.

#### Extended Features (Optional)

- **Custom Methods**: Possibly implement custom methods that offer additional functionality, such as `Promise.any`, `Promise.allSettled`, or even custom utilities that aid in debugging or performance tracking.

- **Optimizations**: Identify opportunities for optimizing promise resolution, possibly through benchmarking and comparing different approaches to handling asynchronous queues or callbacks.

#### Development Environment

- **Tooling**: Node.js, version control (Git), and testing framework Jest.

- **Testing Strategy**:&nbsp;

#### Testing and Documentation

- **Unit Testing**: Each core component and utility method will be accompanied by unit tests to verify its functionality and adherence to expected behaviors.

- **Documentation**:

#### Milestones

1. **Prototype**: Implement a basic promise functionality with executor, `.then()`, and `.catch()`.

2. **Core Features**: Add state management and ensure Promises/A+ compliance.

3. **Extended Features**: Begin adding optional extended features and optimizations.

4. **Testing and Documentation**: Focus on comprehensive testing and begin drafting documentation.
